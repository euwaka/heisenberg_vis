# Visualization

Now, this is a simlified vizualisation of Heisenberg's principle. For the uncertainty, the following formula is used. The wavefunction that was used for the visualization is shown in green. Now, the animation: 
Imagine a gun shooting some quantum particles (say, electrons) that go through a slit. Electrons are modeled by some 2D gaussian blob wavefunction, so before the slit, they have small uncertainty in momentum but large uncertainty in the position. Therefore, the ray of electrons is described as rectangles which is tall in y-axis. When electrons reach the slit, their wavefunction collapses. That means that their uncertainty in y-coordinate is now small and equals to the width of the slit. However, due to Heisenberg's principle, uncertainty in momentum must increase to ensure that the lower bound (that is, h_bar / 2) is satisfied. Thus, now we are not sure in electrons' momenta anymore.

After the slit, the wavefunction expands since Heisenberg's uncertainty principle does not imply any upper bounds. That is, uncertainty in electron's y coordinate grows until electrons are not measured again while the uncertainty in momenta stays unchanged. If we place a screen after the slit, the further we place it, the bigger the resulting pattern will be because with time electrons are more likely to be found in a larger region on the y-axis.

# Applications

Heisenberg's principle is a fundamental concept derived from the equations of Quantum Mechanics. And therefore inevitably this principle is applied in every technology that relies on Quantum Mechanics. On the screen, you can see a few examples.

For instance, in nuclear magnetic resonance samples that are being examined must be irradiated with radio waves that need to be at different frequencies. This was achieved by Richard Ernst et al who realised that one could irradiate a sample with a range of frequencies with the help of the Heisenberg's principle.

In gravitational wave interferometers like LIGO, uncertainty sets limits on the precision of position measurements, and therefore advanced quantum techniques must be utilized to suppress errors (or in technical terms, quantum noise) and increase sensibility of the system.

To sum up, even though Heisenberg's Principle can be expressed using a relatively simple inequality, its implications and applications go as far as Quantum Physics itself, and, once again,  technologies that utilize quantum physics undoubtedly heavily rely on the uncertainty principle.
